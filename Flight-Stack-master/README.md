# Flight Stack

Software examples, scripts and tools in general for the Altax Flight Stack.

##  What is a flight stack?

Due to multi-rotors being inherently unstable, they require active stabilisation. This stabilisation is deployed on a flight controller board, which contains sensors that provide feedback. The stabilisation of a multi-rotor is time sensitive and thus the flight controller must run a real time operating system (RTOS). The Pixhawk project includes a RTOS system called NuttX. If we consider a addition of a companion computer to the avionics system, we can increase the available functionality, e.g., interfacing with more hardware, provide a development environment, communication protocols, among others. Consequentially, the computational resources available for running guidance and navigation algorithms gets a considerable increase. This is will be called Flight Stack.
